# new-portfolio

As mentioned in another <a href="https://github.com/shellygraham/static-portfolio">repo</a>, I finally got around to porting my own portfolio into a CMS. I also took a stab at redesigning it myself. Anyway, it's a 100% custom Wordpress theme built using the Bourbon Neat framework (KISS). You can check it out online <a href="http://shellymgraham.com/">here</a>.
